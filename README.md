# Game-of-Life

## Description
The animation has been based on a cellular automaton invented in 1970 by British mathematic John Horton Conway. The action plays in the two-dimensional grid with cells, and each of the cells is in one of two possible states: dead or alive. 
At each step in time the cells can get alive or dead according to their 8 neighbours: 
- any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population; 
- any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation; 
- any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation; 
- any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 


The user interacts with the animation by setting up the start state, or by changing the current state while the game is paused.
